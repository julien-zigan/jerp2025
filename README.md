# Jerp

Jerp is meant to be an invoicing app for freelance interpreters, who are deployed by PDF deployment confirmations of a constant format. 
Once the user registrated his credentials with the app, the app lets him select a deployment confirmation from his file system and creates the according invoice. Relevant Data is extracted from the deployment confirmation or created automatically (eg. date or invoice-nr).
Changes and alterations can be made in a gui before printing or sending the Invoice as PDF by E-Mail. All Invoices are saved as PDF and the data is stored permanently in a database.
